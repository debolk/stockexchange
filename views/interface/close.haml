    Closing the market will instantly complete any non-matched orders and notify the owners. In addition, it will remove any existing supply and set the supply rate of every available commodity to zero. However, it will not prevent new orders from being created manually and all records will be kept. This essentially clears all state from the market and should be done only when closing the market at the end of trading.
